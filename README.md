Prey and predators simulation (updating..)

Hi !

FNN computation are mostly matrix multiplication and matrix subtraction. GA, I think quick sort is enough for the fitness.

I upload cuda code and 3 readings with good introduction and implementation.

Ready:
1.Shared memory matrix mutiply (link with cpp file)
2.matrix subtraction
3.one demo could be run directly(compile with nvcc)

TODO: 
I am not sure if I should call these functions in FNN or write another complete FNN with all conputation inside, 
because memory copy is always time consuming in cuda. I hope I will finished it this week.
